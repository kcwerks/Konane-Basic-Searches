# Konane-Basic-Searches
Konane is a Hawaiian game for two players. The board consists of 36 puka or slots, arranged in 6 rows X 6 columns. Initially, it is filled with 18 black stones (ili ele) and 18 white stones (ili kea). The player who earns the most points wins. In the beginning, the computer randomly removes one black and one white stone from the board. The player playing black stones plays first, followed by the player playing white stones. After this, the players alternate. If a player does not have a valid move, s/he passes. But, if a player does have a valid move, s/he must make a move. The game ends when neither player can make a move. The player who scores the most points is declared the winner of the game. A player moves one of his/her stones by jumping over an adjacent stone belonging to the opponent, and landing in a vacant puka two removed from the current puka. The player earns one point for each captured stone. Provide users with the ability to determine the next best move(s) using depth-first search, best-first search, breadth-first search, and finally branch and bound algorithm.
